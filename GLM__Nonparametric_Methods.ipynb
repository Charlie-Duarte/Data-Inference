   "source": "By nature, our dataset is fundamentally time-series indexed. If the effect of time on our outcome variable is random, i.e time has a random effect on the number of cases, we can hypothetically treat the data as normal and perform regression. However, we logically believe that the number of cases in a county is in fact correlated with time - as the disease spread/gains momentum mroe cases will arise. This implies that the fundamental assumption of uncorrelated residuals is violated, disallowing us from effectively using GLMs. If it is the case that the data contains autocorrelation, we can account for the trends in time by aggregating the dataset over time for each county - estimating a total sum of cases over a given time period rather than the number of cases on the t+1th day or week. As ARIMA, Prophet and other time-series based methods were not discussed in lecture we opted to remove autocorrelation trends instead, allowing us to use GLMs and nonparametric methods.\n\nTo investigate whether or not our data contains autocorrelation, we utilise durbin-watson tests. More information regarding durbin watson tests can be found below.\n\nA Durbin-Watson value between 1.5 and 2.5 implies little to no autocorrelation, while (0,1.5) and (2.5, 4) implies strong autocorrelation positively and negatively, respectively.

For every state, county we find the last true value and fill nan forward with that value until another true value is found. If nan values persist post-imputation it suggests that there are state, county combinations that entirely consist of nan values. The visualisation below confirms this suspicion. \n\nThis leaves us with two option: \n- Retain state, county combinations that have complete records for every variable/ mobility metric\n    - Results in a dataset of size (286, 9)\n- Remove the two variables/ mobility metrics that appear to have the most missing/nan values (parks_percent_change, transit_stations_percent_change)\n    - Results in a dataset of size (822, 7)\n\nWe decided to remove the two variables containing mostly nan values in order to acheive a larger dataset. We felt it was better to have a larger dataset with 2 fewer explanatory variables than a tiny dataset with more explanatory variables.",
